    In detail, all \ and $ in message are escaped with prefixed \, and an

    called as often as necessary to ensure message is sent fully, as
    socket.send() due to buffering may not send all of it right away.

    Assuming socket is blocking, it's rather improbable that socket.send() will
    be partial / return a positive value less than the (byte) length of msg â€“
    but not entirely out of the question. See:

    This also handles a socket.send() return value of 0, which might be
    possible or not (?) for blocking sockets:

    cannot be decoded as Unicode, None is returned as its representation. Stop
    once socket.recv() returns nothing.

    Under the hood, the TCP stack receives packets that construct the input
    payload in an internal buffer; socket.recv(BUFSIZE) pops up to BUFSIZE
    bytes from that buffer, without knowledge either about the input's
    segmentation into packets, or whether the input is segmented in any other
    meaningful way; that's why we do our own message segmentation with $ as a
