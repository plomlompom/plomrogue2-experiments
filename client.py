        Sets up all widgets for writing to the socket and representing data
        from it. Sending via a self.EditToSocket widget is straightforward;
        polling the socket for input from the server in parallel to the urwid
        main loop not so much:

        The urwid developers warn against sharing urwid resources among
        threads, so having a socket polling thread for writing to an urwid
        widget while other widgets are handled in other threads would be
        dangerous. Urwid developers recommend using urwid's watch_pipe
        mechanism instead: using a pipe from non-urwid threads into a single
        urwid thread. We use self.recv_loop_thread to poll the socket, therein
        write socket.recv output to an object that is then linked to by
        self.server_output (which is known the urwid thread), and then use the
        pipe to urwid to trigger it pulling new data from self.server_output to
        handle via self.InputHandler. (We *could* pipe socket.recv output
        directly, but then we get complicated buffering situations here as well
        as in the urwid code that receives the pipe output. It's much easier to
        just tell the urwid code where it finds a full new server message to
        handle.)
